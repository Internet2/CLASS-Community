# CLASS-Community

The CLASS program provides training and supports workforce development by gathering and curating a collection of training materials tailored to the R&E community, and by providing online training that utilizes these materials. Following the training, Internet2 will continue to convene the cohort where they will create an ongoing community of practice in which they can share information and lessons learned.

This repository contains [a calendar of public events](./public-calendar.md), meeting notes and projects, and [invitiation-only events](./community-calendar.md) for the [CLASS](https://internet2.edu/cloud/cloud-learning-and-skills-sessions/) Community of Practice.
